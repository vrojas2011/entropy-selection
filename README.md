# entropy-selection
This project contains lines of code to select entropy values along the SARS CoV-2 genome in various sample types.  
Excel files table S1 and S2 contain Shannon entropy data for each nucleotide position of the SARS CoV-2 viral genome obtained from genomic sequences downloaded from NCBI. Table S1 (Nasopharyngeal Samples) and S2 (Tracheal Aspirate).
